Elroi is a graphing library built for OPOWER's Astro web application

It is based on the Raphael JavaScript graphing library.


Development
-----------
There are two scripts to aid in developing elroi:
  bin/combine.sh -- Combines all of the elroi source files into a single elroi.js library.
  bin/watch.sh   -- When invoked, this script listens for changes in the working directory
                    and runs combine.sh to regenerate the elroi.js library.

                    The list of directories that watch.rb will listen to is defined in
                    watchr_script.file

Development Requirements
------------------------
To work with combine.sh and watch.rb, you'll need to install two ruby gems:
  gem install watchr
  gem install sprockets

Test
----

Tests are written in QUnit. To run the tests, open this in any browser:
